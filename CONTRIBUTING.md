## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before opening an issue please:
- Search [existing issues](../../issues) to avoid duplicates.
- Confirm the bug is reproducible on the latest version.

When opening a bug report, include:
- A clear, descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce the problem.
- Expected vs. actual behaviour.
- Flutter/Dart SDK versions (`flutter --version`).
- A minimal code sample or link to a reproduction repo if possible.

### Suggesting Features

- Open a [GitHub Discussion](../../discussions) or issue labelled **`enhancement`**.
- Describe the problem your feature solves and how you'd like it to behave.
- Check that the feature aligns with the package's scope (reactive signal-driven state management for Flutter and just_game_engine).

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. Create a topic branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature
   ```
2. Make your changes, following the [Coding Guidelines](#coding-guidelines).
3. Add or update tests for any changed behaviour.
4. Ensure all tests pass:
   ```bash
   flutter test
   flutter analyze
   ```
5. Commit with a [conventional commit message](#commit-message-convention).
6. Push to your fork and open a Pull Request against `main`.
7. Fill in the PR template — describe what changed and why.
8. Address any review feedback promptly.

> **Small PRs are easier to review.** If your change is large, consider opening an issue first to discuss the approach.

## Development Setup

| Tool | Minimum version | Recommended version |
|------|-----------------| --------------------|
| Flutter | 1.17.0 | 3.41.1 |
| Dart SDK | 3.11.0 | 3.11.0 |

`just_signals` is a standalone Flutter package. Clone it and work directly inside the package directory.

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run unit tests
flutter test

# Run the example app
cd example
flutter run

# Lint
flutter analyze
```

To test integration with `just_game_engine`, point the engine's `pubspec.yaml`
to your local fork:

```yaml
dependencies:
  just_signals:
    path: ../just_signals  # local path to your fork
```

## Coding Guidelines

- Follow the official [Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style).
- All public APIs must have **doc comments** (`///`).
- Prefer `const` constructors wherever possible.
- Do not introduce new dependencies without prior discussion in an issue.
- Keep subsystems decoupled — changes to core signals must not break widgets, async, ECS, or memory layers.
- Match the existing file and folder structure under `lib/src/` (`core/`, `widgets/`, `async/`, `ecs/`, `memory/`).
- New public APIs must include at least one test in `test/`.

## Commit Message Convention

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Build process, tooling, dependencies |

**Examples:**
```
feat(physics): add mass-proportional collision resolution
fix(rendering): correct camera transform for non-square viewports
docs(contributing): add development setup section
```
